# Blender-Voxel-Auto-Rigger
A Python script for Blender that automatically generates armatures and weights for voxel models, humanoid and non-humanoid.

Before running the script, make sure that:

-All meshes that intended to have their own bone must have their own Blender objects

-All meshes are closed 

-All faces have their correct normals

-All meshes are touching their intended parent object meshes
